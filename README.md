Hello there! this is my first python program that guess a random number using random(), 
User will be prompted to enter a Starting number and an Ending Number. 
Program will guess a random number and stored it in a variable.
And using while loop we check the guessed number with user entered number and print the result.
**Used Pycharm to write this code**
